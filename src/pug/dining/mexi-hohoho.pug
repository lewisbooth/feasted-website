        p Festivities will look different for 2020 but whether you get to bundle around one table with your loved ones or you will have to get a little more creative this Christmas, our food will be there for you all to enjoy. 

        p Think queueing in the kitchen to get your fix, nattering about ‘what a year it has been’ and piling your plate with pulled turkey or jackfruit, a dollop of cranberry and chilli salsa and eyeing up the tequila slammer brownies waiting on the side. Sit down, take a moment and let us take care of the cooking, offering up amazing tastes this Winter, inspired by the season with nods to doing things differently. 

        p This Winter will be a chance to take stock and stand back from what has been a peculiar and tough year. But, we will round off this lap of the sun with shared stories, fond memories and a chance to tell the tales we have been storing up for the last few months. 

        p You might already have your plans in place and if so, we would love for Feasted to be a part of them. If you’re yet to make your festive arrangements, reach out to a loved one, a friend or someone you have lost touch with and connect with them this Christmas, maybe even over a shared board of Mexi-Ho Ho Ho. 

        p You can find out more here or get in touch to talk it through.
