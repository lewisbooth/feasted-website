          a(href='/dining/board') BOARD
          p We’ve created seasonal takeaway boards that boast bold favours and gorgeous combinations. Bookable for occasions or ‘just because’ this isn’t your average takeaway and we work with local farmers and creatives to use ingredients that are rich and readily available, supporting other businesses as well as bringing you amazing food.

          a(href='/dining/once-upon-a-plate') Once Upon A Plate
          p Gather your friends, gather your family and sit back for an evening of indulgence and magic. 
          p Once upon a Plate is a private dining experience like no other. We work with you to learn about your event or occasion and note the stories and tales that you tell us around your attendees. We will weave this into the story of the food, creating a totally bespoke menu for you and your guests.

          a(href='/dining/barbeque-catering') Barbeque
          p Our BBQ package means that rain or shine, you can sit back and relax with a personal chef keeping an eye on the barbie. 
          p From seitan to steak and everything in between, hunks of halloumi and a whole host of mouth-watering sides, this is a far cry from a pack of sausages and a bag of bread rolls.
